# Representaional Drift In Deep Continual Learning
## Current Progress
- Built an MLP model for FashionMNIST classification and a ResNet-18 model for TinyImageNet classification
- Defined FashionMNIST and TinyImageNet datasets
- Implemented training and evaluation procedures, including standard training and replay-based training
- Added functionality to save models after training
- Note: The current code is **NOT** ready for one-click execution
